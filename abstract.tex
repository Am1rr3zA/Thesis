Anomaly detection systems rely on machine learning techniques to model the normal behavior of the system. This model is used during operation to detect anomalies due to attacks or design faults. Ensemble methods have been used to improve the overall detection accuracy by combining the outputs of several accurate and diverse models. Existing Boolean combination techniques either require an exponential number of combinations or sequential combinations that grow linearly with the number of iterations, which make them difficult to scale up and analyze. In this paper, we propose PBC (Pruning Boolean Combination), an efficient approach for selecting and combining anomaly detectors. PBC relies on two novel pruning techniques that we have developed to aggressively prune redundant and trivial detectors. Compared to existing work, PBC reduces significantly the number of detectors to combine, while keeping similar accuracy. We show the effectiveness of PBC when applying it to a large dataset.
