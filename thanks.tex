None of this would have been possible without the love and patience of my family. My father, my mother, and my sister, to whom this thesis is dedicated, have been a constant source of love, concern, support and strength all these years. I would like to express my heart-felt gratitude to my family first. 

My deepest gratitude is to my supervisor, Dr. Wahab Hamou-Lhadj. I have been amazingly fortunate to have a supervisor who gave me the freedom to explore on my own, and at the same time the guidance to recover when my steps faltered. His patience and support helped me overcome many crisis situations and finish this thesis. I am grateful to him for holding me to a high research standard and enforcing strict validations for each research result. Beside I owe a dept of gratitute to my supervisor's postdoce, Dr. Wael Khreich, who has been always there to listen and give advice. I am deeply grateful to him for the long discussions that helped me sort out the technical details of my work. His insightful comments and constructive criticisms at different stages of my research were thought-provoking and they helped me focus my ideas.
